Snowflake Chrome Extension
==========================

== Build
Run `npm install` to install required dependencies, then `npm run build` to build the extension in the `dist/` directory.

== Install
Instructions to install the extension and test are over at the link:https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked[extension development documentation].

== Develop
You can also use `npm start` to start webpack in watch mode and symlink the resources to make editing easier; source changes should then be reflected immediately in `dist/`.
You will still need to reload the extension in Chrome.
